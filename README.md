> "FOCUS!" - Dwayne The Rock Johnson

A slackbot that helps you stay healthy by randomly selecting people from the channel and assigning exercises to them from time to time.

## Goals

- enable people to use it by easily the deploying to heroku;
- configure exercises on the yml file;
- configure time between callouts on yml file;
- enable to configure a lunch time when there will be no callout;
- enable some interaction with the bot. Eg. when someone says `FOCUS` the bot replies with a The Rock gif;
